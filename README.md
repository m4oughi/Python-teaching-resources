# Python-teaching-resources
<b>Description:</b> Materials that I taught in my class to help my students get a deep dive into Python programming language. 

Welcome to my GitHub account!
In this repository, you’ll find a collection of the course materials related to Python programming language, that I taught at Isfahan University of Technology from January 2020 to April 2021. Each course lasted a total of 60 hours, during which I used live coding techniques. 
Although I misplaced the “.ipynb” files that we created during the classes, I have prepared some PDF files that include course materials. These files are available for everyone to learn from. 
We also have worked on the development of some popular games such as TIC-TAC-TOE, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and more. These projects helped the students to learn and use their knowledge in a practical manner. 
I am proud of receiving positive feedback from my students, who were so satisfied with the class and were enabled to gain a solid understanding of these contents. I have always strived to support my students while completing their thesis. 
I also have experience teaching C++ and various data science packages, including Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Sympy, Pillow, and OpenCV for object detection. I am currently in the process of uploading the course materials to this repository and they will be available as soon as possible. 
Thank you for visiting my GitHub account, and I hope you find the resources provided here helpful in your pursuit of Python programming knowledge.
